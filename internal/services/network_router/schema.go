		MarkdownDescription: "Management of Virtual Network Routers\n\nThis module provides API endpoints for managing virtual network routers in the CloudCIX Compute platform.\nEach project can have one virtual router that provides network connectivity and routing between your cloud\nresources and external networks and one or more static routes. The router manages one or more private networks\n(subnets) and handles traffic routing, NAT, and network isolation for your project's virtual machines and containers.\n\nNetwork Router Type:\n1. Project Router (type: \"router\") - Manage IP forwarding, and participate in routing decisions within isolated\n   network topologies.\n2. Static Routes (type: \"static_route\") - Define a fixed route entry within the Project Router's routing table.\n   It maps a destination network to a nexthop IP, enabling deterministic packet forwarding without dynamic updates.\n\nAvailable operations:\n- List and filter virtual routers from all your projects\n- Create a project's router with one or more private network definitions (RFC 1918 address ranges)\n- Retrieve detailed router configuration including networks, IP addresses, and state\n- Update router by adding networks, changing network names, or changing router state\n\nNetwork Management:\nWhen creating or adding networks, you only specify the IPv4 CIDR range and name. The system automatically\ngenerates VLAN IDs and IPv6 ranges based on regional availability. When updating a router to add new networks,\nyou must include all existing networks (with their auto-generated VLAN and IPv6 properties) to preserve them,\nplus any new networks (with only IPv4 CIDR and name specified). Existing network IPv4/IPv6 ranges and VLANs\ncannot be modified, but network names can be updated by including the name field with existing networks.\n\nEach router includes its associated project, public IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6), private networks with VLANs,\nand current state. You can add additional private networks to an existing router through the update operation.",
